# Damage-Car-detection-using-CNN
The  project focuses on developing a Damage Car Detection System using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) technology to classify damaged and undamaged vehicles. Leveraging a diverse dataset of vehicle images, the CNN model will be trained to recognize patterns indicative of damage, such as dents, scratches, and structural issues. T
